\title{Calculate MAD (Mean Amplitude Deviation)}
\usage{
mad(x, y, z, epoch_samples = 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector. X-axis acceleration}

\item{y}{Numeric vector. Y-axis acceleration}

\item{z}{Numeric vector. Z-axis acceleration}

\item{epoch_samples}{Integer. Number of samples per epoch for averaging}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of MAD values per epoch
}
\description{
Calculates the Mean Amplitude Deviation, an alternative to ENMO that
doesn't require calibration and is less sensitive to calibration errors.
}
\details{
MAD = (1/n) * sum(|r_i - mean(r)|)
where r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)

MAD measures the mean absolute deviation of the acceleration signal from
its mean, making it robust to constant offsets (including gravity and
calibration errors).
