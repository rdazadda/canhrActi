\usage{
wear.choi(
  counts_per_minute,
  non_wear_window = 90,
  spike_tolerance = 2,
  min_spike_length = 1,
  spike_stoplevel = 100,
  min_window_len = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts_per_minute}{Numeric vector of activity counts (one value per epoch)}

\item{non_wear_window}{Integer. Window length in minutes for initial non-wear detection (default: 90)}

\item{spike_tolerance}{Integer. Maximum consecutive minutes with activity allowed (default: 2)}

\item{min_spike_length}{Integer. Minimum length of spike (default: 1, reserved for future use)}

\item{spike_stoplevel}{Integer. Maximum count value for spike (default: 100)}

\item{min_window_len}{Integer. Required consecutive zeros before/after spike (default: 30)}
}
\value{
Logical vector where TRUE indicates wear time, FALSE indicates non-wear
}
\description{
Choi et al. (2011) algorithm with upstream/downstream window validation.
The Choi algorithm extends Troiano by requiring that any spike of activity
within a non-wear period must be surrounded by consecutive zero-count windows
of at least 30 minutes on at least one side.
