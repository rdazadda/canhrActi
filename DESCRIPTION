Description: Comprehensive ActiGraph accelerometer data analysis suite developed
    by the Center for Alaska Native Health Research (CANHR). Implements scientifically
    validated algorithms including the official ActiGraph activity counts algorithm
    (Neishabouri et al., 2022), Choi (2011) and Troiano (2007) wear time detection,
    and Freedson (1998) intensity cut points. Produces results matching ActiLife
    software. Designed for reproducible physical activity research with comprehensive
    documentation and user-friendly functions for complete AGD file analysis.
