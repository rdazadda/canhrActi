Description: Comprehensive accelerometer data analysis suite developed by the Center
    for Alaska Native Health Research (CANHR). Implements scientifically validated
    algorithms including the official ActiGraph activity counts algorithm (Neishabouri
    et al., 2022), Choi (2011) and Troiano (2007) wear time detection, Freedson (1998)
    intensity cut points, Cole-Kripke and Sadeh sleep scoring, and 12 METs prediction
    algorithms. Features unique wake period inversion (sleepwaker methodology) for
    separating sleep from waking sedentary behavior. Includes circadian rhythm analysis
    (L5, M10, IS, IV, cosinor), sedentary fragmentation metrics, and auto-calibration
    for raw data. Supports ActiGraph (.agd, .gt3x), GENEActiv (.bin), Axivity (.cwa),
    and generic CSV files. Produces results compatible with ActiLife software.
