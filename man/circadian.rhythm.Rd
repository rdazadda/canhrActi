}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Numeric vector of activity counts (typically axis1 or VM)}

}
\value{
List with class 'canhrActi_circadian' containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{L5} - Least active 5-hour average
\item \code{L5_start} - Start time of L5 window
\item \code{M10} - Most active 10-hour average
\item \code{M10_start} - Start time of M10 window
\item \code{RA} - Relative amplitude (M10-L5)/(M10+L5)
\item \code{IS} - Interdaily stability (0-1)
\item \code{IV} - Intradaily variability (0-2+)
\item \code{cosinor} - Cosinor analysis results (MESOR, amplitude, acrophase)
\item \code{hourly_profile} - Average activity by hour of day
\item \code{daily_metrics} - Per-day circadian metrics
}
}
\description{
Comprehensive circadian rhythm analysis including non-parametric (L5, M10, IS, IV, RA)
and parametric (cosinor) methods for characterizing 24-hour activity patterns.
}
\details{
\strong{Non-Parametric Metrics (van Someren et al., 1999):}
\itemize{
\item \strong{L5} = Average activity during the least active 5 consecutive hours.
Typically corresponds to nighttime/sleep.
\item \strong{M10} = Average activity during the most active 10 consecutive hours.
Typically corresponds to daytime activity.
\item \strong{RA} = Relative amplitude = (M10 - L5) / (M10 + L5).
Higher values indicate stronger day-night differences.
\item \strong{IS} = Interdaily stability. Measures consistency of activity patterns
across days. Ranges 0-1, higher = more stable rhythm.
\item \strong{IV} = Intradaily variability. Measures fragmentation of activity.
Approaches 0 for perfect sine wave, 2 for Gaussian noise.
}

\strong{Cosinor Analysis:}
Fits: Y(t) = MESOR + Amplitude * cos(2\emph{pi}t/24 + Acrophase)
\itemize{
\item \strong{MESOR} = Midline Estimating Statistic Of Rhythm (rhythm-adjusted mean)
\item \strong{Amplitude} = Half the peak-to-trough difference
\item \strong{Acrophase} = Time of peak activity (hours from midnight)
}
}
