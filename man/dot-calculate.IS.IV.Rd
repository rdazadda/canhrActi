\title{Calculate Interdaily Stability (IS) and Intradaily Variability (IV)}
\usage{
.calculate.IS.IV(counts, timestamps, epoch_length = 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Numeric vector of activity counts}

\item{timestamps}{POSIXct timestamps}

\item{epoch_length}{Epoch length in seconds}
}
\value{
List with IS and IV values
}
\description{
IS measures consistency of activity patterns across days.
IV measures fragmentation of the activity rhythm.
}
\details{
IS Formula: IS = n * sum((Xh - X_mean)^2) / (p * sum((Xi - X_mean)^2))
IV Formula: IV = n * sum((Xi - Xi-1)^2) / ((n-1) * sum((Xi - X_mean)^2))

Where:
\itemize{
\item n = total number of data points
\item p = number of data points per day (typically 24 for hourly data)
\item Xh = mean activity for hour h across all days
\item Xi = activity at data point i
\item X_mean = overall mean activity
}
