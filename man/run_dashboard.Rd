\description{
Launches the interactive Shiny dashboard for accelerometer data analysis.
The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for all canhrActi analysis
functions including wear time detection, sleep analysis, physical activity
classification, circadian rhythm analysis, and batch processing.
}
\details{
The dashboard includes the following modules:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Data Upload}: Load AGD, GT3X, or CSV files, configure subject info
\item \strong{Overview}: Quick summary of data quality and key metrics
\item \strong{Wear Time}: Detect wear/non-wear time using Choi, Troiano, or CANHR algorithms
\item \strong{Sleep Analysis}: Cole-Kripke, Sadeh, and Tudor-Locke sleep detection
\item \strong{Physical Activity}: Intensity classification and MVPA bout detection
\item \strong{Circadian Rhythm}: L5, M10, IS, IV, and cosinor analysis
\item \strong{Batch Processing}: Process multiple files at once
\item \strong{Export}: Generate CSV exports and HTML reports
}
}
