\usage{
wear.CANHR2025(
  counts_per_minute,
  non_wear_window = 120,
  spike_tolerance = 3,
  min_spike_length = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{counts_per_minute}{Numeric vector of activity counts (one value per epoch)}

\item{non_wear_window}{Integer. Window length in minutes (default: 120)}

\item{spike_tolerance}{Integer. Maximum consecutive minutes with activity allowed (default: 3)}

\item{min_spike_length}{Integer. Minimum length of spike (default: 1, reserved for future use)}

\item{spike_stoplevel}{Integer. Maximum count value for spike (default: 150)}

\item{min_window_len}{Integer. Upstream/downstream window length in minutes (default: 45)}
}
\value{
Logical vector where TRUE indicates wear time, FALSE indicates non-wear
}
\description{
CANHR 2025 algorithm with upstream/downstream window validation.
Based on Choi algorithm with parameters optimized for Alaska Native populations
and cold climate activity patterns.
