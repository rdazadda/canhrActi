\title{Count Steps from Raw Acceleration Using Peak Detection}
\usage{
steps(
  acceleration,
  sampling_freq = 60,
  peak_threshold = 0.0359,
  min_step_interval = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{acceleration}{Numeric vector of vertical axis acceleration (Y-axis) in g-units}

\item{sampling_freq}{Numeric. Sampling frequency in Hz (default: 60)}

\item{peak_threshold}{Numeric. Minimum peak height in g (default: 0.0359 for wrist)}

\item{min_step_interval}{Minimum time between steps in seconds (default: 0.3)}
}
\value{
Integer. Total number of steps detected
}
\description{
Implements step detection based on published research using bandpass filtering
and zero-crossing detection. Uses wrist-worn threshold (0.0359g) from
transparent step detection methods.
}
\details{
The algorithm follows published ActiGraph step detection methodology:
\itemize{
\item Bandpass filter: 0.25-2.5 Hz (4th order Butterworth, zero-lag)
\item Threshold: 0.0359g (validated for wrist-worn devices)
\item Detection: Zero-crossing with threshold on filtered acceleration
}
