\title{Wear Time Detection Using Troiano Algorithm}
\usage{
wear.troiano(
  counts_per_minute,
  non_wear_window = 60,
  spike_tolerance = 2,
  spike_stoplevel = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts_per_minute}{Numeric vector of activity counts (one value per epoch)}

\item{non_wear_window}{Integer. Consecutive zero minutes for non-wear detection (default: 60)}

\item{spike_tolerance}{Integer. Maximum consecutive minutes with activity allowed within non-wear (default: 2)}

\item{spike_stoplevel}{Integer. Maximum count value considered as spike (default: 100)}
}
\value{
Logical vector where TRUE indicates wear time, FALSE indicates non-wear
}
\description{
Troiano et al. (2008) algorithm for detecting non-wear time in accelerometer data.
Non-wear is defined as 60+ consecutive minutes of zero counts, allowing for up to
2 consecutive minutes of counts between 1-100 (spikes).
