\title{Convert Counts Per Epoch to Counts Per Minute (CPM)}
\usage{
to_cpm(counts, epoch_length = 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{Numeric vector of counts per epoch}

\item{epoch_length}{Epoch length in seconds (e.g., 30, 60, 10)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of counts per minute (CPM)
}
\description{
Converts activity counts from any epoch length to standardized counts per minute.
This is essential for applying cutpoints which are defined for 60-second epochs.
}
\details{
The Freedson and other cutpoint algorithms are calibrated for 60-second epochs.
When using data collected at different epoch lengths, counts must be converted
to CPM before applying cutpoints:
\itemize{
\item 60-second epochs: CPM = counts (no conversion needed)
\item 30-second epochs: CPM = counts * 2
\item 15-second epochs: CPM = counts * 4
\item 10-second epochs: CPM = counts * 6
}
}
\examples{
# 30-second epoch data
counts_30sec <- c(500, 1000, 2500)
cpm <- to_cpm(counts_30sec, epoch_length = 30)
# Returns: 1000, 2000, 5000

}
